# Checksum Validation

**Short Definition:** The TDA validates checksums against those stored in the Information Package at Ingest or Access.

## Description and Scope
The Checksum Validation process compares the checksums that come with the *Information Package*, with checksums based on the current state of the *File*'s data. Checksums of *Files* are validated at *Ingest* or *Access* to a TDA. The checksums may be either part of 1) a *SIP*; 2) an imported *AIP*; or 3) an *AIP* stored in the *TDA*.

A misalignment between the checksum algorithms used in the *Information Package* and the TDA's checksum policy's list of algorithms may occur. For example, incoming *Information Packages* (*SIPs* and *AIPs*) may include a checksum with a different algorithm created by the producer. In the case of *AIPs*, the checksum policy might have been updated during the lifecycle of the TDA, resulting in the removal and/or addition of algorithms. In such cases, the process should use whatever algorithm is associated with a given checksum to the best of its potential.
